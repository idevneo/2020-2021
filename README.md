## Welcome!

This is the 2019-2020 Skystone repository for team QuadX 6299.

Written in primarily Kotlin our library makes use of RevExtensions2, FTC Dashboard, and our own custom Pure Pursuit implementation

All of the interesting code can be found here: TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode

I wrote a white paper about the Pure Pursuit Algorithm that can be found here:
